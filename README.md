# Practical Work - Billard
Practical work completed as part of computer graphics course.

This project:
* Implements Gouraud, Phong, and Blinn-Phong shading to billiard balls.
* Implements billiard ball textures.
* Implements linear motion and rotation of billiard balls.
* Implements collision detection between two billiard balls and the collision of a billiard ball on
a segment of wall.

## Demo

## Controls
* The R and E keys reset the position of the billiard balls.
* WASD keys move the position of the light.
* The Q key resets the position of the light.
* The left mouse button allows you to apply an impulse to the chosen billiard ball.
* The right mouse button allows you to move the chosen billiard ball.
* Hold the left/right mouse button to move the camera.
* Press the spacebar to start the physics simulation in the test scene (Test.html).
